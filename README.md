#Overview
This project contains SSO extensions to the APIClient library.  These 
extensions enable SSO communications with the APIClient library.  The 
ObjectModel library is not supported at this time. 

For each language, there is a project that can be used to build a library 
(VersionOne.APIClient.SSOExtension) and a project that demonstrates how to 
use that library in an application.
